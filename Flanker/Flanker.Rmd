```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)
```

This example runs a basic flanker experiment in jspsych, using code I think mostly from the jspsych documentation. This example mostly uses javascript for everything, including stimulus generation.
