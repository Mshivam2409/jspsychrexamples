```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)
```

This example uses a custom plugin to collect multiple keyboard responses on each trial. This is an example of modifying an existing jspsych plugin. In this case the modified plugin can be found in:  `jspsych-6/plugins/jspsych-html-keyboard-multiple-response.js`

The index.html file runs the experiment, the index.rmd file compiles the html experiment. 

The run.R file will run compile and run the experiment in a local browser, with data saved to the data folder.
